### Note that i added a few extra things:
1. After all the golbin dies , a boss demon(got a different sprite to work)  is spawned to fight off the wizards. They have more health and power.
2. Elder Goblins are powerful goblins which are rarely spawned (P (Elder Goblin) = 0.25 in a spawn)
3. Also the if the HP of the goblin is less than 25% of its maxHP , Life Steal begins and the they heal off half of the missing health of the wizard they attack.
